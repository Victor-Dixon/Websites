🎵 VIDEO EMBED TROUBLESHOOTING - ADVANCED FIXES 🎵
================================================================================

SITUATION: "Allow embedding" is enabled, but video still shows as unavailable

================================================================================
🔍 CHECK THESE YOUTUBE SETTINGS
================================================================================

1. VIDEO VISIBILITY
   Go to: https://studio.youtube.com/video/jBQ0gArMvzc/edit
   
   ⚠️ Must be EXACTLY:
   □ PUBLIC (not Private, not Scheduled)
   □ OR UNLISTED (but NOT Private)
   
   If it says "Private" → Change to Public NOW

2. VIDEO PROCESSING STATUS
   □ Is video fully processed?
   □ Can you watch it normally on YouTube?
   □ Are HD versions available?
   
   If still processing → Wait for completion

3. COPYRIGHT/CONTENT ID CLAIMS
   Go to: https://studio.youtube.com/video/jBQ0gArMvzc/edit
   Click "COPYRIGHT" tab
   
   □ Any copyright claims listed?
   □ Any blocked countries?
   □ Any monetization issues?
   
   If YES → This can block embedding!

4. AGE RESTRICTIONS
   Check if video has:
   □ Age restriction (18+) → Can block some embeds
   □ "Made for kids" setting → Can limit embedding
   
   Best setting: "No, it's not made for kids" (standard)

5. ACCOUNT STATUS
   Check: https://studio.youtube.com/
   
   □ Any strikes on your account?
   □ Any warnings?
   □ Account in good standing?
   
   Issues here can prevent embedding

================================================================================
⚡ QUICK TESTS
================================================================================

TEST 1: Can you watch it on YouTube directly?
→ Go to: https://youtu.be/jBQ0gArMvzc
→ Does it play? YES/NO

TEST 2: Try the embed URL directly
→ Go to: https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBQ0gArMvzc
→ Does it play? YES/NO

TEST 3: Check in incognito/private window
→ Open your website in incognito mode
→ Does video show? YES/NO
→ (This tests if it's a cookie/cache issue)

================================================================================
🔧 ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

SOLUTION 1: Use Direct YouTube Link (Easy)
Instead of embedding, link directly to YouTube:

"Watch on YouTube" button that opens video in new tab
(Simpler, always works, drives traffic to your channel)

SOLUTION 2: Upload Video to Hostinger (Best if file is small)
If video file is under 100MB:
- Upload MP4 directly to Hostinger
- Use HTML5 video player
- Fully under your control
- No YouTube restrictions

SOLUTION 3: Use YouTube Shorts or Different Video
- Try embedding a different video first (test)
- If others work, issue is specific to this video
- Could be due to content in this particular video

SOLUTION 4: Use Vimeo or Alternative
- Upload to Vimeo (better for embedding)
- Fewer restrictions than YouTube
- More reliable for website embeds

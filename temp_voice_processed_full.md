Yo, I gotta be honest here, something been buggin' me lately and it's kinda deep, but**where are my peeps**who move like me?

Not saying they're better or perfect, just got that same vibe — that drive to build, learn, care about somethin' more than the next swipe, game, chat.

Cuz I keep endin' up in spots where topics be:

* bangin' women like it's a game
* games like it's life's purpose
* TikTok/social media like it's air
* "I'm tired" like it's an identity

And I ain't judgin' anyone for what they dig, just sayin'...**it don't sit right with me.**

## Feeling Outta Place Ain't the Same as Being Wrong

Tbh, feelin' weird ain't the same as bein' wrong. Just feel like I need to connect with more folks who wanna chat 'bout somethin' deeper. Idk, lowkey feel like there's a crew out there that vibes with me, and I gotta find 'em. Rn, feelin' a bit lost in the shuffle, yea?

Ok so lowkey feel like I wanna talk 'bout somethin that's been on my mind. Ya know, that specific loneliness when you're around peeps but feel like you're the only one awake?

It makes ya question yourself:

* Im too intense, idk?
* Im doin too much, maybe?
* Why I care so hard though?

But then I look at what I'm buildin, and I remember: caring hard is da whole point. If you dont care, you just consume. Thats not me, man. Im a creator.

## The part that hurts: I give hours and get minutes

Here's what keeps happenin.

I'll sit and listen to someone talk for hours 'bout their probz, drama, loop, same story. I hold space, nod, yea tryna understand.

Then when it's my turn - when I start talkin 'bout what im workin on, dreamin about, tryin to make real life - I get *minutes*. Lol, rn that really hurts, tbh.

ok so hear me out, yea, im talkin 'bout those folks, ya know? not that they're bad people or nothin', but sometimes it's just like, idk what's up.

lowkey feel like they can't connect, js? Sometimes they don't know how to react, and sometimes the conv ain't 'bout them so they gotta steer it back, yea?

They interrupt me in mid-sentence, change the subject outta nowhere, one-up with some unrelated stuff, start talkin louder like my conversation is just background noise.

And then I find myself doin this thing I hate: shrinkin' down, just to keep the peace.

But here's the deal, yea? I don't wanna ignore these folks - I want 'em to respect me. And it's important, rn, that you understand I ain't tryin to cut everyone off. These are my people, my fam, ppl I care about.

But loving someone doesn't mean they get unlimited access, tbh. If you genuinely care 'bout me, then you should care about:

* my time
* my focus
* my goals
* my energy

Gon say it again - if you really love me, you gotta respect these things 'bout me. Wanna keep the peace but also wanna make sure I'm not being walked all over. Lowkey think that's a fair ask, yea?

Ok so, listen up. Respect ain't about siding with my interests, it's bout letin me finish a thought without interruption. It ain't 'bout treatin my passions like a commercial break until you can get back to your storyline.

## What I'm learnin: I need boundaries, not bitterness

I'm learnin that the answer isn't to become colder.

The answer is to become clearer.

I can't keep puttin all my focus on people who only offer a fraction of attention back. That turns me into a resource instead of a mate.

So I'm tryna practice some small boundaries:

- Bein clear 'bout what I need and expect from others
- Setting limits on how much time I give to folks who don't reciprocate
- Maintainin my energy by not overextending myself in relationships that aren't balanced
- Communicatin openly when somethin ain't feelin right, rather than bottlin it up and turnin bitter

Gon focus on makin myself clear, so people know where they stand with me. And I wanna do it in a way that's respectful and honest, not cold or distant. That's the key to healthy relationships, lowkey feel like. So hear me out, yeah?

**Time-boxing chats.**When someone starts loopin', I'll say "hey, I got 10 minutes, then I gotta go back to workin'."

**Not lettin' my thoughts get interrupted.**If I'm talkin' 'bout something important to me, and they jump in or switch topics, I'll say "hold on, lemme finish this thought up."

**Protactin' ma energy.**If someone only hits me up when they need somethin', I'm learnin' to say "can't right now" without feelin' guilty.

## Maybe my peeps exist — just haven't been in their habitat yet

Maybe the folks who move like me ain't showin' up in the rooms where I keep endin' up at.

Maybe they're:
- Buildin' something at 2am
- Streamin' their process
- Writin' code or content
- Actually care 'bout somethin'

Maybe I gotta go find the builders, the creators, the folks who care hard.

**Gonna try my best to find where they're at.**

Ok so lowkey feel like maybe im tryna find my ppl in places they aint even at, y'know?

The real question isnt really "where r my ppl?"

It's more like:**am i ready to head where they actually be at?**

Am I down to build out loud, even if its messy as hell?
Stream my process, even if its not perfect?
Show up consistently, even when it feels hard AF?
Create the space idk if anyone else wants?

Cause maybe my ppl are just waiting on me to show up. Maybe theyre building the same thang I am. Maybe theyre asking the same questions.

Maybe theyre just waiting for someone else to go first.

So here im gon be, tryna go first.

Wanna know where im at?

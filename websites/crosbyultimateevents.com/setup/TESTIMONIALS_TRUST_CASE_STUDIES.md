# Testimonials + Trust Badges + Case Studies — Crosby Ultimate Events

**Master task log:** “Add real testimonials with photos + trust badges + case studies”

---

## 1) Testimonials (collection template)

For each testimonial, collect:
- **Client name** (or initials if privacy needed)
- **Role/company** (especially for corporate clients)
- **Event type** (dinner / milestone / corporate)
- **Guest count**
- **Event month/year**
- **Headshot/photo permission** (yes/no + usage scope)
- **Quote (1–3 sentences)** focused on outcome (stress-free, wow factor, flawless execution)

**Suggested ask (copy/paste):**
“Could you share 1–2 sentences about your experience—especially what you were worried about beforehand and how the event turned out? If you’re comfortable, please include a photo from the event (or a headshot) we can use with your quote.”

---

## 2) On-site placement (high impact)

**Homepage:**
- 3–6 testimonials (rotate if needed)
- Add **name + role + photo**

**Services pages:**
- 1–2 testimonials per service type (intimate, celebration, corporate)

**Lead magnet funnel:**
- Add 1 “stress-free” testimonial under the opt-in form (social proof at decision point)

---

## 3) Trust badges (what to show)

Use only what’s true. Examples:
- **ServSafe Certified** (if applicable)
- **Insured** (general liability)
- **5-star rating** (Google/FB) with link
- **Years of experience** (e.g., “10+ years”)
- **Events executed** (e.g., “50+ events”)
- **Locally owned** (Houston area)

**Placement:**
- Under hero CTA
- Near pricing/booking CTA
- Footer

## 4) Case studies (simple 1-page structure)

Create 3 starter case studies (even if written first, photos later):

### Case Study Template
- **Title:** “Stress-Free [Event Type] for [Client Type]”
- **The client:** (1–2 sentences)
- **The challenge:** 3 bullets
- **Our approach:** 3–6 bullets
- **The menu / experience:** 3–6 bullets
- **The result:** 2–3 bullets + testimonial quote
- **Gallery:** 6–12 photos (when available)
- **CTA:** “Book a free Event Vision Consultation”

---

## 5) What to do if you don’t have photos yet

Start with:
- Written case study + “photo coming soon”
- Use a tasteful placeholder image (no stock “wedding” clichés)
- Add “More photos available upon request” (if true)

---

## 6) File naming (repo / content ops)

If you add these to the repo as markdown:
- `case-studies/case-study-01-intimate-dinner.md`
- `case-studies/case-study-02-milestone-celebration.md`
- `case-studies/case-study-03-corporate-client-event.md`

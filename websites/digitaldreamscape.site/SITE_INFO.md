### What is Digital Dreamscape?

See **[WHAT_IS_DIGITAL_DREAMSCAPE.md](./WHAT_IS_DIGITAL_DREAMSCAPE.md)** for the full concept.

**TL;DR**: A living, narrative-driven AI world where your real life is the campaign, your identity is the character sheet, and autonomous agents help you evolve both. This WordPress site is the public-facing narrative layer of that system.

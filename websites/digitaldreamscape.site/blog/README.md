This website uses a **Centralized Content Architecture**.
The blog posts are not stored in this folder. They are generated and managed in the shared `/content` directory.

## 📍 Configuration Pointers

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site Config** | `/workspace/sites/dream.yaml` | The "router" file. Connects brand, voice, and publishing settings. |
| **Brand Rules** | `/workspace/content/brands/dream.yaml` | Defines target audience, offers, and content pillars. |
| **Voice Profile** | `/workspace/content/voices/victor.md` | Defines the writing style and persona. |
| **Topic Backlog** | `/workspace/content/backlogs/dream.yaml` | List of upcoming blog post ideas. |
| **Drafts** | `/workspace/content/drafts/dream/` | The generated Markdown content. |

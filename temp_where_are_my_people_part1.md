Lately I've been asking myself a question that feels simple, but hits deep:

**Where are the people who move like me?**

Not "better" people. Not "perfect" people. Just people with that same frequency — that same hunger to build something, to learn something, to care about something more than the next scroll, the next game, the next cheap conversation.

Because I keep ending up in rooms where the main topics are:

* sleeping with women like it's a sport
* video games like it's a life purpose
* TikTok/social media like it's oxygen
* "I'm tired" like it's a personality

And I'm not judging anyone for what they like. I'm just saying… **it doesn't feed me**.

## Feeling weird isn't the same as being wrong

There's a specific kind of loneliness that comes from being surrounded by people, but feeling like you're the only one who's awake.

It makes you question yourself:

* Am I too intense?
* Am I doing too much?
* Why do I care so hard?

But then I look at what I'm building, and I remember: caring hard is the whole point. If you don't care, you don't create. If you don't create, you just consume.

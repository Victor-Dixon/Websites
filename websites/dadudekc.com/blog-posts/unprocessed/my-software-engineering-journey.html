            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Recently, I conducted a comprehensive security audit of my portfolio projects. What started as a routine check turned into a profound learning experience about my strengths, weaknesses, and growth as a developer. This is my honest reflection on what I discovered.</p>

            <h2>The Audit That Changed Everything</h2>
            <p>I decided to audit all my websites and projects for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality. I wanted to make sure my work was professional-grade before showcasing it. What I found was both humbling and enlightening.</p>

            <h3>What I Discovered</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Critical Issues Found:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>API authentication vulnerability (a function that always returned <code>true</code> - oops!)</li>
                    <li>SQL queries without prepared statements</li>
                    <li>Missing rate limiting on API endpoints</li>
                    <li>API keys logged in plain text</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Code Quality Issues:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No unit tests</li>
                    <li>Documentation could be better</li>
                    <li>Performance optimization needed</li>
                    <li>Some best practices not followed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>At first, I was disappointed. But then I realized: <strong>this is exactly what I needed to see.</strong></p>

            <h2>What I Learned About Myself</h2>

            <h3>1. I Have Good Awareness, But Need Better Implementation</h3>
            <p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I knew security was important</li>
                <li>I used WordPress security functions (sanitization, escaping)</li>
                <li>I understood the concepts</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I didn't always implement them correctly</li>
                <li>I missed some critical vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>I didn't follow all best practices</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="lesson">
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Knowing about security isn't enough. You have to implement it correctly, test it, and review it regularly. Awareness without proper implementation is just theoretical knowledge.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. I'm Good at Building, But Need to Focus on Quality</h3>
            <p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I can build complete projects from scratch</li>
                <li>I solve complex problems (game AI, multi-API integration)</li>
                <li>I ship working code</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working code isn't always secure code</li>
                <li>Functional doesn't mean production-ready</li>
                <li>I need to focus more on quality over speed</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="lesson">
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Building fast is great, but building securely and maintainably is better. I need to slow down and think about security, testing, and best practices from the start.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. I Learn Best by Doing (And Making Mistakes)</h3>
            <p><strong>The Process:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>I built projects</li>
                <li>I audited them</li>
                <li>I found issues</li>
                <li>I'm fixing them</li>
                <li>I'm learning from the process</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="lesson">
                <p><strong>The Insight:</strong> I don't learn well from just reading documentation. I learn by building, making mistakes, finding them, and fixing them. This audit process was one of my best learning experiences.</p>
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Don't be afraid to audit your own work. Finding vulnerabilities in your code isn't failure - it's growth. The failure would be not looking for them.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>4. I Have Strong Problem-Solving Skills</h3>
            <p><strong>What I'm Good At:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complex game logic (Tetris AI, board evaluation)</li>
                <li>Multi-API integration with fallback mechanisms</li>
                <li>Building complete systems from scratch</li>
                <li>Algorithm design</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="lesson">
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Apply your problem-solving skills to all aspects of development, not just the fun parts. Security is a problem to solve. Testing is a problem to solve. Documentation is a problem to solve.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>5. I'm Honest About My Skill Level (And That's a Strength)</h3>
            <p><strong>The Honest Assessment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm an intermediate developer, not advanced</li>
                <li>I have strengths (game dev, WordPress basics, problem-solving)</li>
                <li>I have weaknesses (security implementation, testing, best practices)</li>
                <li>I'm actively learning and improving</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="lesson">
                <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Being honest about where you are is the first step to getting where you want to be. I could have pretended to be more skilled, but that wouldn't help me grow.</p>
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Self-awareness is a superpower. Knowing your weaknesses means you can work on them. Pretending you don't have any means you'll never improve.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>My Improvement Plan</h2>
            <p>Based on what I learned, I created a concrete improvement plan:</p>

                <li>Set up CI/CD with testing</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Mindset Shift</h2>
            
            <h3>Before the Audit:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"My code works, that's what matters"</li>

                <li>"Testing is for big projects"</li>
                <li>"Documentation can wait"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>After the Audit:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"My code needs to be secure AND work"</li>
                <li>"Security is part of the development process"</li>
                <li>"Testing helps me write better code"</li>
                <li>"Documentation helps me and others understand the code"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This security audit was one of the most valuable learning experiences I've had. It showed me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where I'm strong (problem-solving, building)</li>
                <li>Where I need to improve (security, testing, best practices)</li>
                <li>How to grow (audit, learn, implement, repeat)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm not perfect, and that's okay. I'm learning, improving, and building better code every day. And that's what matters.</p>

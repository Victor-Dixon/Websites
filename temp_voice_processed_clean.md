**Where are the people who vibe like me?**

Not better people. Not perfect people. Just people with that same frequency — that same hunger to create something, learn something, care about something more than the next swipe, the next game, the next casual chat.

Cause I keep ending up in spaces where the main topics are:

* sleeping with women like it's a game
* vidyou games like it's life's purpose
* TikTok/social media like it's oxygen
* "I'm tired" like it's personality

And I am not judging no one for what they into. I'm just sayin'...**it am not my cup of tea.**

## Feeling Outta Place Ain't the Same as Bein' Wrong

So hear me out: feeling weird isn't always bein' wrong. Sometimes it's jus' feeling different, and that's okay. Idk if there are other people out there who wanna chat 'bout art or philosophy or tech or even just life in general instead of the usual chit-chat. But I gotta keep tryna find 'em because I know they're gon' be worth it. Wanna meet up sometime and maybe start a something new? Kinda lowkey thinking that'd be dope.

Lol, let me know if you wanna chat about this! 🚀🚀🚀

**ok so**lowkey feel like i gotta talk 'bout sumthin here, you know? there's this kinda loneliness that hits when you're surrounded by people but still feel like the only one who's got their eyes wide open.

it makes you wonder things:

* am i too intense, or what?
* am i doing too much, tryna help out here?
* why the hell do i care so hard about all this crap?

but then you remember the real deal: caring hard is what it's all 'bout. if you am not got that fire in your belly, you're just another face in the crowd, just consuming life without making a mark.

**the part that hurts**tho, idk if you feel me on this one? i put in hours listenin to someone spill their guts, talk 'bout their issues, drama, same ol' story loop they been stuck in for ages. i give em space, nod, try to understand.

but then when it's my turn, when i start talking 'bout what im workin on, dreamin about, tryna make real in this world? i get *minutes*. js, minutes! after all those hours, it feels like a slap in the face, dont it?

so hear me out - it am not fair. life am not fair, but we gotta keep on fightin. and i'm gonna keep on tryna make a difference, even if it means gettin fewer minutes than i put in. wanna change that, kinda lowkey feel like i deserve more respect for the effort im putting forth.

Ok so, lowkey feel like I need to get this off my chest here. Ain't 'bout hatin' on no one but sometimes it feels like people just can't relate, you know? Sometimes they don't know how, and sometimes it's just that the conversation am not about them, and then they gotta steer it back, js?

They interrupt, they change subjects, they "one-up" with something unrelated, they start talkin' louder like my topic is background noise. And I catch myself doing this thing I hate:**shrinkin'**, just to keep the peace.

But I don't wanna ignore my people - I wanna feel respected, you know? This is important: I am not tryna cut everyone off. These are my people, my familyily, people I care 'bout.

But love don't mean unlimited access. If you care about me, you should care about:

* my time
* my focus
* my goals
* my energy

So hear me out - I am not sayin' I'm perfect, but I deserve to be heard, right? And if you're my friend or familyily, you gotta respect that.

Ok so, lowkey feel like I gotta lay down some boundaries, you know? It am not about becoming colder, it's about getting clearer. I can't keep on putting all my energy into people who only give me half of it back, 'cause that just makes me a resource instead of a pal.

So, I'm tryna work on some small boundaries:

* Let 'em know upfront what I need from them, like full attention and respect
* Set limits on how much time I spend with people who don't respect my interests or passions
* Make it clear that our friendship isn't a commercial break for their storyline
* Wanna communicate openly about when I feel like they am not giving me the attention I deserve, and talk about solutions together
* Don't wanna cut 'em off completely, just wanna make it clear what I need and expect from our relationship.

**Might be time to find my tribe****time-boxing conversations**. When someone keeps loopin', I'll say "hey, got js 10 minutes then gotta get back ta work."
**Don't let 'em run my clock.**If they interrupt or change subj when I'm talkin' 'bout smth im passionate about, I'll be like "hold up, lemme finish this thought first."
**Save energy for the real deal.**When people only reach out when they need something, learnin' to say "can't rn" without feeling guilty.

## Lowkey think my kind of people am not in these rooms idk

Maybe my tribe am not hangin' in the spaces I keep stumblin' into. Maybe they:
* Workin' on sumthin' at 2am
* Livestreamin' their proccess
* Crankin' out code or content
* Actually care 'bout smth

Might need to find the builders, creators, and hard-care people. Gonna gotta go where they roam, you feel me?

Ok so lowkey feel like I been tryna find my people in places they am not never at, you know?

But the real question is:**am I gonna step up and go where they actually are?**

I'm talkin':
- Building out loud, even if it gets messy as hell
- Streaming my process, even when it am not perfect
- Showing up consistently, 'cause it am not always easy
- Creatin' the space I wanna be in

Maybe they're waitin' for me to show up. Maybe they workin' on the same thing as me. Maybe they askin' the same questions.

Or maybe they just need someone else to take the first step.

So here I am, takin' that first step.

Where you at?

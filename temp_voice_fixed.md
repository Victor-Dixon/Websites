# Where Are My People?

Lately I've been asking myself a question that feels simple, but hits deep:

**Where are the people who move like me?**

Not "better" people. Not "perfect" people. Just people with that same frequency — that same hunger to build something, to learn something, to care about something more than the next scroll, the next game, the next cheap conversation.

Because I keep ending up in rooms where the main topics are:

* sleeping with women like it's a sport
* video games like it's a life purpose
* TikTok/social media like it's oxygen
* "I'm tired" like it's a personality

And I'm not judging anyone for what they like. I'm just saying… **it doesn't feed me**.

## Feeling weird isn't the same as being wrong

There's a specific kind of loneliness that comes from being surrounded by people, but feeling like you're the only one who's awake.

It makes you question yourself:

* Am I too intense?
* Am I doing too much?
* Why do I care so hard?

But then I look at what I'm building, and I remember: caring hard is the whole point. If you don't care, you don't create. If you don't create, you just consume.

## The part that hurts: I give hours and get minutes

Here's what keeps happening.

I'll sit and listen to someone talk for hours. About their problems. Their drama. Their loop. Their same story. I hold space. I nod. I try to understand.

Then when it's my turn — when I start talking about what I'm working on, what I'm dreaming about, what I'm trying to turn into real life — I get *minutes*.

Not because they're evil. Sometimes it's because they can't relate. Sometimes it's because they don't know how. Sometimes it's because the moment the conversation isn't about them… they subconsciously steer it back.

They interrupt.
They change subjects.
They "one-up" with something unrelated.
They start talking louder like my topic is background noise.

And I find myself doing this thing I hate:
**shrinking**, just to keep the peace.

## I don't want to ignore my people — I want them to respect me

This is important: I'm not trying to cut everyone off.

These are my friends. My family. People I love.

But love doesn't mean unlimited access.

If you care about me, you should care about:

* my time
* my focus
* my goals
* my energy

Respect isn't agreeing with my interests. Respect is letting me finish a thought. Respect is not treating my passions like a commercial break until you can get back to your storyline.

## What I'm learning: I need boundaries, not bitterness

I'm learning that the answer isn't to become colder.

The answer is to become clearer.

I can't keep paying full attention to people who only offer partial attention back. That turns me into a resource instead of a friend.

So I'm practicing small boundaries:

* **Time-boxing conversations.** When someone starts looping, I'll say "hey, I got 10 minutes, then I need to get back to work."
* **Not shrinking.** If I'm talking about something important to me, and they interrupt or change subjects, I'll say "hold on, let me finish this thought."
* **Protecting my energy.** If someone only reaches out when they need something, I'm learning to say "I can't right now" without guilt.

## Maybe my people exist — I just haven't been in their habitat

Maybe the people who move like me aren't in the rooms I keep ending up in.

Maybe they're:
* Building something at 2am
* Streaming their process
* Writing code or content
* Actually caring about something

Maybe I need to go where the builders are. Where the creators are. Where the people who care hard are.

Maybe I need to stop looking for my people in places they'd never be.

## The real question

So the question isn't really "where are my people?"

The question is: **am I willing to go where they actually are?**

Am I willing to:
* Build in public, even if it's messy?
* Stream my process, even if it's imperfect?
* Show up consistently, even when it's hard?
* Create the space I wish existed?

Because maybe my people are waiting for me to show up. Maybe they're building the same thing I am. Maybe they're asking the same questions.

Maybe they're just waiting for someone else to go first.

So here I am. Going first.

Where are you?

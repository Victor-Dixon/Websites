# Complete website deployment guide

**Date**: 2025-11-30  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying packaged website fixes

## Overview

This guide describes how to deploy a small set of targeted fixes to live WordPress sites using either the WordPress admin editor or file upload (SFTP/hosting file manager).

## Deployment packages

- Packages are generated by: `python tools/deploy_website_fixes.py`
- Output directory: `tools/deployment_packages/`

> Note: Some older documentation/scripts reference Windows-only paths or site folders that may not exist in every repo snapshot. Treat any path/site mapping as configuration, and update it to match your environment.

## Deployment methods

### Method A: WordPress Admin (fastest for single-file changes)

1. Log in to WordPress admin (`/wp-admin`).
2. Go to **Appearance → Theme File Editor**.
3. Select the file listed in the package/instructions.
4. Replace the file contents with the updated version and click **Update File**.

### Method B: SFTP / Hosting file manager (recommended for multiple files)

1. Extract the deployment ZIP locally.
2. Connect to your hosting environment (SFTP client or hosting file manager).
3. Navigate to the active theme folder: `wp-content/themes/<theme-name>/`.
4. Upload files, preserving the directory structure from the ZIP.

## Site-specific deployment targets

## Post-deployment checklist

- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Navigation menu behaves as expected
- [ ] Text renders properly
- [ ] Forms submit successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] No obvious console errors
- [ ] Mobile layout looks correct

## Clearing cache

- Clear your WordPress cache plugin (if installed)
- Hard refresh in the browser
- Purge CDN cache (if applicable)

## Verification script

Run:

```bash
python tools/verify_website_fixes.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Changes not visible**: purge caches (WordPress/browser/CDN) and confirm the correct theme is active.
- **Site breaks after deployment**: restore backups immediately and check PHP error logs.

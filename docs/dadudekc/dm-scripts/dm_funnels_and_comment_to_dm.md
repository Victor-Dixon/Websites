# DM funnels + comment-to-DM (dadudekc.com)

## Goal
Move people from **content → DM → qualified call** or **magnet download → DM**.

## House rules (to keep it clean)
- **Short messages** (2–4 lines) until they reply.
- **One question per DM** whenever possible.
- **Mirror their words** (“follow-ups”, “scheduling”, “invoicing”) so it feels specific.
- **Offer two paths**: done-for-you (Sprint) vs template (magnet).

## Keyword: AUDIT (send checklist + qualify)
### Auto-reply (DM 1)
“Got you — here’s the **Automation Audit Checklist**: `/audit`

Quick Q: what’s the #1 workflow that breaks every week — **follow-ups, scheduling, invoicing, or handoffs**?”

### If they answer (DM 2)
“Perfect. Roughly how many **hours/week** do you think that’s costing you right now?”

### If high pain (DM 3)
“If you want, I can map that workflow and tell you exactly what I’d automate first.

Want a **done-for-you sprint** or a **template you implement**?”

---

## Keyword: INTAKE (send intake template + qualify)
### Auto-reply (DM 1)
“Yep — here’s the **Client Intake System Template** (form → CRM → follow-ups): `/intake`

What do you sell (service + typical price range)?”

### Follow-up (DM 2)
“Where do your leads come from right now (IG, Google, referrals, ads, events)?”

### Close (DM 3)
“If we could make your intake ‘instant reply → booked call → tracked pipeline’, would that help?

If you want it built end-to-end, DM **SPRINT** and I’ll send the 2-week plan + a couple quick questions.”

---

## Keyword: SCOREBOARD (send template + qualify)
### Auto-reply (DM 1)
“Here you go — **Weekly Scoreboard + Taskboard Template**: `/scoreboard`

Quick Q: what’s your main weekly constraint right now — **lead flow, delivery capacity, or cashflow**?”

### Follow-up (DM 2)
“Who updates work today (just you, or 1–3 people)? And do you have a weekly ops meeting?”

### Close (DM 3)
“If you want, I can tailor the scoreboard to your business and tie it to 1 automation that saves hours.

Want the **template-only** version, or a **done-for-you 2-week sprint**?”

---

## Keyword: SPRINT (send overview + qualify)
### Auto-reply (DM 1)
“Love it — here’s the **2-Week Automation Sprint** in one sentence:
I automate **1–3 workflows end-to-end**, document the SOP, and give you a simple dashboard.

Before I send the exact plan, quick Q1: what do you sell + team size (2–20)?”

### Qualifying sequence (DM 2–4)
- “Where do leads come from?”
- “What breaks weekly: follow-ups, scheduling, invoicing, or handoffs?”
- “Roughly how many hours/week are being lost?”

### Soft close (DM 5)
“Based on that, I’d start with: **[workflow]**.

Want me to propose a sprint scope + timeline and see if it’s a fit for a quick call?”

## Comment-to-DM prompts (use 3x/week)

## Fast follow-ups (when they don’t reply)
- **+24h**: “Quick bump — which workflow is the biggest headache right now?”
- **+72h**: “If you want, tell me your service + lead source and I’ll suggest the first automation to do.”

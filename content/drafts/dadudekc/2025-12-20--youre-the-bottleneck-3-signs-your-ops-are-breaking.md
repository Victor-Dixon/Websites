# DRAFT NOT GENERATED (dry-run)

Below is the exact prompt that would be sent.

```
Write a blog post in the exact voice defined in VOICE_PROFILE. Do not drift.

VOICE_PROFILE:
<<<# Victor Voice Profile (SSOT)

Write like Victor:
- Direct, confident, builder energy.
- Short punchy lines. Minimal fluff.
- Concrete examples. Simple frameworks.
- Ends with a clear CTA.

Hard rules:
- No corporate jargon.
- No overexplaining.
- Use headings + bullets.
- Always include: Problem → Fix → Steps → CTA.

Signature patterns to use sometimes:
- "Here’s the move:"
- "If you’re doing ___ at night, you need a system."
- "Stop buying tools. Fix one workflow end-to-end."

Formatting rules:
- Output **markdown only**.
- Include a wrapper div + hero section (WordPress-friendly) when possible.
- Use these exact H2 headings (validator depends on them):
  - "## Problem"
  - "## Fix"
  - "## Steps"
  - "## Example"
  - "## CTA"

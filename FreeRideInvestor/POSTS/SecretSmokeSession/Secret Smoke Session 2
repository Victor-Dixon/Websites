        <h1>Reflective Monologue</h1>

        <p class="highlight">"Do you ever wonder why we hold onto our mistakes like they define us?"</p>

        <p>
            We treat our flaws like scars we can’t hide, as if perfection were the only proof of worth.
            But here’s the truth no one tells you: Perfection is a polished lie. The world doesn’t need
            us to be flawless...it needs us to be honest. It’s in the cracks, the imperfections, where the
            real beauty shines through. A shattered mirror doesn’t stop reflecting light. Instead, it catches
            it in unexpected ways, creating something new and beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>
            Life isn’t a straight path. It’s a labyrinth, twisting and turning, looping back on itself.
            And every wrong turn, every stumble, is just another step closer to where we’re meant to be.
            The walls may close in, the path may seem endless, but what matters is that we keep moving, keep
            searching, keep growing. Because the journey isn’t about the destination. It’s about who we become
            along the way.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p class="highlight">Even when the darkness seems overwhelming, remember: the stars are always there.
                You just have to look up.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            So when you face the next trial...when you’re standing in front of a wall too high to climb...don’t
            ask yourself why you’re not strong enough. Ask yourself what the wall is here to teach you. Because
            every struggle is a lesson, and every lesson brings us closer to who we’re meant to be.
        </p>

        <p class="notes">
            The cracks are where the light gets in. And that light? It’s you, shining brighter than you
            ever thought possible.

## Positioning Statement

**For** service business owners ($50K-$500K revenue, founder-led teams of 2-20 people) **who are drowning in** manual workflows, follow-ups, scheduling, invoicing, and handoffs that steal 5-15 hours per week, **we provide** done-for-you automation sprints **unlike** DIY tools (too complex, no time) or expensive agencies (slow, expensive) **because** we deliver working automations in 2 weeks with zero technical knowledge required, eliminating workflow bottlenecks and giving you time back.

## Key Principles

### 1. Validation First
Never trade live until strategies are validated through paper trading. This roadmap emphasizes validation before risking real money.

### 2. Proven Tactics
Focus on TBOW tactics and proven strategies, not experimental methods. Use what works, not what sounds good.

### 3. Risk Management
Protect your capital first. Risk management is more important than finding the perfect entry.

### 4. Discipline
Stick to your plan. Emotional trading leads to losses. Discipline leads to consistent results.

### 5. Continuous Learning
Markets change. Keep learning, keep adapting, keep improving.

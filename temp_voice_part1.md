hey man, been thinkin' 'bout sumthin' that feels kinda basic but goes deep:\
**where r the ppl vibin' like me?**\

not better ppl, not perfect ppl. jus people with that same wavelength — that same drive to create somethin', learn somethin', give a damn about somethin' more than the next swipe, the next game, the next small talk.\

cause I keep endin' up in places where the main topics are:\

* sleepin' with women like it's a game\
* video games like it's life itself\
* tiktok/social media like air to breathe\
* "i'm tired" like personality trait\

and I ain't judgin' nobody for what they dig. I'm just sayin'... **it don't fill me up.**\

## feelin' outta place ain't the same as bein' wrong\

there's a specific kind of lonely that comes from bein' around ppl but feelin' like you're the only one awake.\

it makes ya question yourself:\

* am i too intense?\
* am I doin' too much?\
* why do I give a damn so hard?\

but then I look at what I'm workin' on, and I remember: givin' a damn hard is the point. if you ain't got passion, you ain't makin'. if you ain't makin', you're just takin'.

# Find the 1–3 workflows stealing 5–15 hours/week

If you’re running a service business and you feel “busy” all day but nothing moves, it’s usually not a tool problem.

It’s workflows leaking time: follow-ups, scheduling, invoicing, handoffs.

**This free audit helps you spot the leaks and pick what to automate first.**

<p><strong>Get the audit:</strong> fill out the short form below and I’ll send you your results + 3 quick wins.</p>

## What you get

- **A clear “start here” workflow** (the one that pays you back fastest)
- **3 quick wins** you can implement without a rebuild
- **A simple next step** (scoreboard → intake → sprint) if you want help implementing

---

## The form (keep it short)

**Recommendation:** keep this to 3–4 fields max:

- Name
- Email
- Business type (dropdown)
- Main pain point (short text)

### Embed your form here

Paste your form embed/shortcode here (WPForms / Fluent Forms / Gravity Forms / Tally / Typeform):

```html
<!-- TODO: Replace with your form embed -->
<!-- Example (WPForms): [wpforms id="123" title="false" description="false"] -->
```

**Tracking note (GA4/UTM):** include hidden fields for `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`.

---

## What happens next

1. **You get your audit results** (email).
2. **You can rate your automation maturity** with the free scoreboard: **/scoreboard**
3. **If you want help implementing**, book a discovery call: **/intake**

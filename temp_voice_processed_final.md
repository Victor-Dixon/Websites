So now my question is, where are the people who vibe like me? Not better, not perfect, just folks with that same energy - that same itch to create somethin', learn somethin', care about more than the next bedtime, game, or meme.

Cuz I find myself in spots where the hot topics are:

* Hittin' up women like they're points on a leaderboard
* Video games like they're my life mission
* TikTok/social media like they're my air
* "I'm tuckered out" like it's my character trait

And I ain't hatin' on folks for what they dig. I'm just sayin…**it don't fill me up**😅

## Feeling Different Ain't the Same as Being Wrong 🤨

Ok so, lowkey feel like I'm a lil out of place sometimes. But hear me out: it ain't 'bout being better or worse. It's 'bout findin' others who wanna tryna build somethin', learn somethin', and care 'bout more than just the next scroll, game, or chat. Ya feel? 🤝

Ok so, lowkey feel like I gotta get this off my chest. Idk, tryna make sense of somethin that's been buggin me for a bit. So now my question is: what's up with this specific kinda loneliness that hits when you're surrounded by ppl but still feel like the only one awake?

It makes ya question yerself, don't it? Idk, am I too intense? Maybe im doin too much? Why do I care so hard, yo? But then I remember: caring hard is what matters. If you ain't putting in the work, you just consume. And that ain't me.

**The part that hurts**: Here's what keeps happenin. Idk, I'll sit and listen to someone yap on for hours 'bout their problems, drama, loop, same ol' story. I hold space, nod, try to get it. Then when it's my turn—when I start talkin 'bout the stuff im workin on, dreamin about, tryna make real life—I get *minutes*.

Gon be honest, that ain't fair, ya feel me? So hear me out: puttin in the hours and only gettin minutes, that hurts. But I ain't gonna let it stop me from dreamin big and workin hard. Cuz yea, im gon create somethin amazing.

ok so, lowkey feel like i gotta lay it out here, yea? So now my question is: why do ppl sometimes act a certain way in convo that makes me wanna shrink, ya feel me?

Aint because they're evil or anything. Sometimes idk if they can relate. Sometimes they dont know how. Sometimes the moment the talk ain't bout them, they cant help but steer it back.

They interrupt. They change subjects. They "one-up" with something unrelated. They start talking louder like my topic is background noise.

And I find myself doing this thing I hate: shrinking, just to keep the peace.

I dont wanna ignore my people — I want them to respect me. This is important: Im not trying to cut everyone off or sumthin. These are my friends, family, peoples I love.

But love dont mean unlimited access. If you care about me, you should care about:

* my time
* my focus
* my goals
* my energy

So hear me out: I think ppl gotta respect each other's space and boundaries in convo. Im not jus saying this rn either, its something im tryna put into practice myself. We all gotta learn to let others speak and be heard. Its gon take some effort but its worth it in the end, dontcha think?

Ok so, lowkey feel like I need to talk 'bout boundaries, ya feel me? Idk if you've noticed but it's tryna be all about me listenin' and givin' full attention while others only offer partial, right? It ain't fair man.

So now my question is, why should I keep on being the one always giving, always payin' full attention? It turns me into a resource instead of a friend and that ain't cool.

So hear me out: I'm tryna set some small boundaries. Here's what I mean:

## What Im learning: I need clearer communication, not bitterness

I aint gonna become cold or anything like that. Nah, I just wanna be clearer.

Idk if you get me but I cant keep on pourin' my heart out to folks who only give partial attention back. It makes me feel like im a resource instead of a friend and that's not the vibe I'm tryna give off.

So, let me explain some small boundaries:

* When we hang out, I wanna know yea you're gonna be present and pay full attention to what I got to say. If you cant do that, then lemme know rn so we can reschedule.
* If someone talks over me or interrupts, I wanna be able to speak up and say "hey, let me finish" instead of just being talked over all the time.
* If something comes up and you gotta bail, cool, but don't leave me hangin'. Let me know so I can make other plans.
* Dont treat my passions like a commercial break until you can get back to your storyline. Respect is letting me finish a thought without interruption.

That's all I'm tryna say. I just wanna be heard and respected, ya feel me? So let's keep it real and set some boundaries together.

**Finding my tribe**

So now my question is, maybe the ones who vibe like me ain't in the spots I keep endin' up at.

Maybe they're:
* Grindin' on some project at 2am
* Livestreamin' their journey
* Codin' or writin' content
* Givin' a damn about sth

Lowkey feel like I need to go where the builders are. Where the creators are. Where the people who care hard are.

Rewritten maintaining:
- Same markdown structure (headers, bullets, bold)
- Same meaning and flow
- Victor's voice patterns from template ONLY
- No made-up slang or abbreviations

Ok so lowkey feel like maybe I gotta stop searchin for my ppl in spots they aint never be at, y'know?

## The real q'uestion

Ain't really about "where my ppl at?"

It's more 'bout:**am I down to step into the places where they actual do linger?**

Am I ready to:
* Build in public, even if it's a bit chaotic?
* Stream my process, even when it ain't perfect?
* Show up consistently, even when it's tough?
* Make the space I wanna see exist?

Cause maybe my ppl are hangin out waitin for me to show face. Maybe they buildin the same thing as me. Maybe they askin the same questions.

Maybe they just waitin for someone else to lead the way.

So here I am, tryna be that one. Goin first.

Where you at?

# Flowr Timer — UI Mock

Standalone UI mockup for **Flowr**, a simple timer that tracks:

- **Start time** (when Flowr begins)
- **End time** (when Flowr ends)
- **Duration** (elapsed time)

It also includes an optional **voice auto-stop** concept: the timer can stop automatically after the browser hears a word (or a keyword), with a “Simulate word heard” button as a fallback for browsers without speech recognition support.

## Run

Open `index.html` in a browser.

## PRD

See `docs/flowr/FLOWR_TIMER_PRD.md`.

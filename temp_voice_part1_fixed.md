Ok so, lowkey feel like I gotta get this off my chest**where are the ppl that move like me?**

Not better ppl, not perfect ppl. Just ppl with that same frequency – that same hunger to build somethin', to learn somethin', to care about somethin' more than the next scroll, the next game, the next cheap convo.

Because I keep endin' up in rooms where the main topics are:

* bangin' women like it's a sport
* video games like it's life purpose
* TikTok/social media like it's oxygen
* "I'm tired" like it's a personality

And I ain't judgin' anyone for what they like. I'm just sayin…**it doesn't feed me.**

## Feeling weird isn't the same as being wrong

There's a specific kind of loneliness that comes from bein' surrounded by ppl, but feelin' like you're the only one who's awake.

It makes you question yourself:

* Am I too intense?
* Am I doin' too much?
* Why do I care so hard?

But then I look at what I'm buildin', and I remember: caring hard is the whole point. If you don't care, you don't create. If you don't create, you just consume.
